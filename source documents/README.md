##Script 
`load_link.py` used to retrieve paper links from html files in "ACM Digitial Library links" folder, and load them into Google Sheet 

**Note:** *The way to run it should be similar to the script `script/generate_programs/session-generator.py`. Please check related document in [script/generate_programs](https://github.com/brighten/SIGCOMM2014/blob/master/scripts/generate_programs/README.md) folder*
