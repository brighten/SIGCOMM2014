<h2 class="hcls">Motivation of the tutorial</h2>

<p>Smart mobile devices are pervasive; people in all corners of society, from young children to corporate executives, are today regularly glued to their devices for entertainment, social activity, and business critical functions. In recent years, we have witnessed the explosive growth and rapidly changing nature of mobile applications (apps), hot competition between device manufacturers creating a plethora of different smart devices, and an associated enormous growth in traffic volumes in cellular networks. The phenomenal traffic growth and vast diversity in both applications and devices have introduced imposing challenges on service providers as they drive to maintain excellent service quality for hundreds of millions of mobile users. These challenges will increase over the coming years as the Internet of Things becomes a reality and introduces even more diverse traffic characteristics.</p>

<p>The cellular networks that support these devices and their applications are extremely complex and are also changing at a rapid pace. The underlying wireless technologies are evolving (moving from GSM/2G to UMTS/3G to LTE/4G and small cells, with 5G and even 6G technologies being defined for future deployment). Network architectures are changing (e.g., from circuit-switched to packet-switched voice services, and with network elements being virtualized), networks are becoming more autonomous (e.g., Self-organizing networks) and capacity and coverage are being constantly expanded in a bid to keep up with the pressing demand. The rapid evolution of networks, mobile devices and mobile applications, the complex interactions between them, and their large scale and heterogeneity makes management of service quality in this complex ecosystem challenging.</p>

<p>Historically, the focus of network operations teams has been on managing the links and elements that comprise the network. While this focus on network element operation is foundational, it is by no means sufficient to assure adequate end-to-end performance. In complex and heterogeneous networks like today's cellular networks, service and performance impairments may result from subtle inter-layer and inter-element interactions, may not always be evident in any traditional alarming or monitoring systems, may be difficult to detect, and may be even harder to localize and repair. Quantifying the service impact of network outages has also provided interesting technical challenges. There is tremendous redundancy in mobile networks &mdash; both within the core of the network and in the Radio Access Network (RAN). Thus, even a fairly large outage may have minimal or no customer impact. Although highly desirable from a service point of view, this necessitates sophisticated analytics to be able to quantify the service level impact of underlying network events, so that responses to them can be prioritized. Thus, in the modern world in which smart phones and devices are supported by mobile cellular networks, there is a need for a holistic end-to-end service view to support those devices and their users.</p>

<p>Technology advances have addressed many of the challenges of managing service performance in the rapidly changing cellular network environment. Such innovations focus on service performance measurement, relating service performance with network events, and quantifying the service impact of network events.</p>

<h2 class="hcls">Tutorial Focus</h2>

<p>This tutorial will provide attendees with a glimpse into the challenges service providers face when managing service quality in today's cellular networks and how they address these challenges in order to improve the users' smartphone experiences. Attendees will be given an overview of the complex network and service architectures embodied in todayâ€™s cellular networks. They will leave with an understanding of the technical complexity and resulting technologies which address relating network events to service impact, managing cross layer and inter-network interactions, detecting, localizing and correlating service impairments, and the importance of proper application design and its impact on user experience. In addition, the tutorial will highlight remaining research opportunities for advancing the state of the art in cellular service quality management.</p>

<p>The tutorial will be organized as follows. We will begin with a brief overview of cellular networks and their service architecture. We will then describe technological innovations created to support service-centric management in a cellular network. We will cover a broad variety of topics ranging from mobile device performance measurements, statistical anomaly detection to identify service issues, association of service events to network issues that would enable effective diagnosis from an operational perspective, automated learning of service dependencies using statistical correlations, and service impacts induced by network events such as outages, and network changes such as software upgrades and maintenance. We will explore the need for data analytics in support of both real-time operational problems as well as longer term engineering issues. We will discuss strategies for resolution of the service impairments and driving them out of the ecosystem. We will also highlight several open research opportunities that the industry and academic can tackle through collaborative efforts.</p>

<p><b>Type of Tutorial:</b> Lecture &mdash; The sessions will include presentations, demonstrations and insightful operational experiences </p>

<p><b>Requirements for the Attendees:</b> None &mdash; Background of networking and statistical data mining is useful but not a requirement</p>
