Visa support letters are answered in the order they are received. You will receive a PDF letter by email within the next 4-5 business days.  Please note we do not fax visa support letters.  The PDF serves as a signed electronic version of the original letter which will be mailed to your current mailing address.  If you do not receive the letter by post mail on time for your visa appointment, please print out your PDF letter and take it with you.
