ACM SIGCOMM 2014 Web Site
=========================

PHP/HTML/CSS/JS code for the ACM SIGCOMM 2014 web site, based on the ACM SIGCOMM 2012 site.

You are welcome to reuse and adapt this code for your conference. It is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License. Please see http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/. Source code is available at https://github.com/ryanrhymes/SIGCOMM2012.

Under the license, you acknowledge "ACM SIGCOMM 2012" as the source and you link to http://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2012/. You will also share any changes and improvements to this code openly. The best way to do so is to fork our github repository at https://github.com/ryanrhymes/SIGCOMM2012.

What's in the various subdirectories:

* `css`			CSS code, only edit style.css, the rest is from vendors
* `css/images`	jquerymobile CSS images
* `images`		our images (logos, etc.)
* `include`		PHP partials and code
* `js`			Javascript, only edit script.js, the rest is from vendors
* `workshops`	workshop CFPs in various formats stuff
* `paper`		PDF copies of the various papers - not part of the repository due to copyright issues
* `scripts`		various helper scripts to check and compile the site

This site uses a bunch of open javascript libraries. You will want to use their latest versions:

* http://jquery.com/ - the javascript goes into `js`
* http://jquerymobile.com/ - the javascript goes into `js` and the CSS and images go into `css`
* http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css - the CSS for the jquerymobile documentation page, goes into CSS
* http://code.google.com/p/css3-mediaqueries-js/ - the javascript goes into `js`


Cache manifest for offline usage
--------------------------------

The `scripts/publish` script generates this automatically. Edit the script to control which objects are included in the manifest.


Creating a minified version of the site
---------------------------------------

Much better to publish this minified version than the source files. Bash script in `scripts/publish`.

In order to save time, this script does *not* optimize any images. You should really run your images through pngquant (http://pngquant.org/) and then image_optim (https://github.com/toy/image_optim) before you add them to the repository.


Local test server
-----------------

With recent versions of PHP, you can run a development test server on your machine like this: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8000`


Checking for broken links
-------------------------

Run a local test server (see above) and then run `linklint` (http://www.linklint.org/):

    linklint -doc report -http -host 127.0.0.1:8000 /@

Checker results are in `report/index.html` afterwards.


Checking for HTML issues
------------------------

Run a local test server (see above) and then run `bash scripts/lint`.
